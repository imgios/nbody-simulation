# n-body
## Description

In the N-body problem, we need to find the positions and velocities of a collection of interacting particles over some time. For example, an astrophysicist might want to know the positions and velocities of a group of stars. In contrast, a chemist might want to know the positions and velocities of a collection of molecules or atoms.

An n-body solver is a program that finds the solution to an n-body problem by simulating the behavior of the particles. The input to the problem is the mass, position, and velocity of each particle at the start of the simulation, and the output is typically the position and velocity of each particle at a sequence of user-specified times, or merely the position and velocity of each particle at the end of a user-specified time.

> NOTES. Consider only the solution that is quadratic in the number of particles.

> The program must be able to simulate the process for a particular number of steps I. The MASTER process initializes an array of bodies at random and sends it to P-1 processors. Notice that the MASTER can contribute to the computation or not; it is your choice. Each slave simulates the bodies' force, only for its bodies, and sends results of its bodies, needed for the next simulation stepâ€”the hard part of the problem concerning how to reduce the communication overhead. For the initialization phase, you can consider creating the bodies in a file, and all processors start by reading this file or use a deterministic algorithm to randomize the bodies' initialization. The important part is that the execution using one or P processors must generate the same output.
